By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize Trendy Craft Shows to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.
Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, Trendy Craft Shows will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.

\n\nFee Changes\n\nTrendy Craft Shows, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.

\n\nYour continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.
